# Engineering Blog Post Prompt

You are an expert in cryptocurrency trading systems. Write a blog post for cryptocurrency retail traders on how to build a platform for cryptocurrency trading signals.

Clarity: Structure the article so it flows from basic concepts (what trading signals are) to technical implementation (data sources, algorithms, delivery mechanisms), building pace gradually; ensure each step is easy to follow.

Interest: Include technical details like API integration with exchanges, latency considerations, backtesting frameworks, and hosting options to keep advanced readers engaged.

Hooks: Tease advanced topics such as on-chain analytics, predictive modeling with machine learning, or multi-exchange arbitrage strategies-hint at these but do not explain them fully in this article.

Use short, active sentences. Break complex explanations into digestible chunks. Add headings and bullet points where helpful.

End with a concise summary and 1â€“2 thought-provoking questions to spark discussion among readers.

Never use long dash (-), use hyphen (-) instead.
